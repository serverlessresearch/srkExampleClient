# Example SRK Client

This repo provides an example of how to use SRK as a library in your own
benchmarks. It simply installs a hard-coded "echo" workload and invokes it
once. This is equivalent to the example given in SRK's README, but now as a
standalone program. This allows for the creation of more sophisticated benchmarks.
